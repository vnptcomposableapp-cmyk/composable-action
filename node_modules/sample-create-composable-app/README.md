# Create Plasmic App

The easiest way to get started with Plasmic for a new code base is with `create-plasmic-app`. Under the hood, we'll use `create-next-app`, `create-gatsby`, or `create-react-app` to help create a new app, and set it up with Plasmic.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx create-plasmic-app
```
